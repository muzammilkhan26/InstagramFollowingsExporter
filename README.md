### Step 1: Export Instagram Cookies

2. **Export cookies:**

   - Use the extension to export cookies as `cookies.txt`
   - Save the file to your computer

### Step 2: Use the Application

1. **Launch the app:** Run `python main.py`
2. **Load cookies:** Drag & drop your `cookies.txt` file or browse to select it
3. **Choose output folder:** Select where you want to save the exported data
4. **Configure options:**
   - ‚úÖ **Fetch stats & bio** - Get detailed user information (slower)
   - ‚úÖ **Verified only** - Export only verified accounts
   - ‚úÖ **Private only** - Export only private accounts
   - ‚úÖ **Embed thumbnails** - Add profile pictures to Excel file

5. **Click "Download Followings"** and wait for completion

## üìä Output Files

The application generates several files:

- **`followings_username_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`** - Basic CSV format
- **`followings_username_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`** - JSON format with all data
- **`followings_username_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`** - Formatted Excel with hyperlinks
- **`added_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`** - Newly followed accounts (if any)
- **`removed_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`** - Unfollowed accounts (if any)

## üìà Data Fields

Each export includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Username | Instagram username |
| Profile Link | Direct link to profile |
| Full Name | Display name |
| Verified | Verification status (YES/NO) |
| Private | Private account status (YES/NO) |
| User ID | Internal Instagram user ID |

| Bio | Profile biography (if detailed fetch enabled) |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Rate Limiting:** The app includes built-in delays to avoid Instagram's rate limits
- **Cookie Expiry:** Cookies expire periodically - re-export them if you get authentication errors
- **Large Lists:** For accounts following 1000+ users, enable "Fetch stats & bio" only if needed (much slower)
- **Privacy:** This tool only accesses your own following list - it cannot access private data of other users

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Session invalid ya expired hai"
- Re-export cookies.txt from your browser
- Make sure you're logged into Instagram in the browser
- Clear browser cache and re-login if needed

### "Username se user_id parse nahi ho paya"
- Check if your account is still active
- Verify cookies.txt file is not corrupted
- Try logging out and back into Instagram

### Application won't start
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check if all dependencies installed correctly

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing:** All data processing happens locally on your computer
- **No Data Sharing:** No information is sent to external servers
- **Cookie Safety:** Cookies are only used to authenticate with Instagram's API
- **Open Source:** Full source code available for review
